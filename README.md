Also the process to get a statistical analysis Z-Test
In collaboration with Paola

The full notebook is in the main.

## Overview ##
In this project we were exploring data sets using data analysis, statistical methods and generating insights to solve the needs of Computing Vision.

## Business Understanding ##
Our team is currently tasked with generating valuable insights as computer vision ventures into the film industry:

*The movies who have the higher earnings and its categories 
*The best categories to develop a movie in 
*The most likely successful directors within these categories to make a successful movie 
*Find out if the duration of a movie has an influence in the earnings and engagement


## Data Understanding and Analysis
*The data that we used is from pages about movies such as the moviedb.org and rotten tomatoes. We used them due to their records where we     got info such as movie ratings, genres, directors, etc

*We used data sets with more than 140,000 entries and using statistical measures such as mean or standard deviation to understand the         behavior of data

*The conclusions and graphs we‚Äôre getting from the information of the datasets, such as the graph of the most popular genres in movies using   columns from im.db dataset

*We had to adjust our analysis due to limitations with some datasets that weren¬¥t up to date and other ones had missing data
